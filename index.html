   <img src="https://progradjr.github.io/my-ambition/assets/developer.jpg" id="ambition">
   <p>I want to become a Software Developer because I have always been curious about new technologies. How the applications run, games are created. Now that I have started to learn about coding I find it interesting and very simple to do. I look forward to creating many applications and games.</p>
